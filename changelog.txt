LavaLust Version 2

# Changelog

## Security
To access your index file from public folder, put index.php inside it and change the ff:
1. ROOT_DIR should be dirname(__DIR__);
2. add .htaccess file inside your root directly
    AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    # Route all other requests
    RewriteRule ^(.*) public/$1 [L]
    </IfModule>
3. add .htaccess file inside your public folder
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [QSA,L]
    </IfModule>

## Update url_helper
Add exit option as 4th parameter of the function

## Optional usage of mod_rewrite
You can remove the .htaccess file and access the url like http://website.com/index.php/controller/model/args
If you want to use the previous way like http://website.com/index.php/controller/model/args, rename the htaccess.example
to .htaccess only.

## Fixed Cookie samesite error in PHP version < 7.3
set_cookie($name, $value, $expiration, array())

## Fixed Session Class / flashdata() problem wiht PHP 8. [2.0.4]

## Update model methods inside controller. [2.0.4]

If you are using version <= 2.0.3 you will need to update every calls on your model.
Before, you are creating model like class Example_model{} and load it using $this->call->model('example')

Now model method has a second optional parameter which is the object name you want to use aside
from the class name itself. So if you have something like class Example_model {}, you can now call it using
$this->call->model('example_model', 'example'). Then if you are going to use it, just use $this->example->some_method().
You can also use array to load methods by using key & value. Example $this->call->model(array('key' => 'value'))
which is key is the new object name you want to use and value is the actual class name.

Regular usage now is class My_model {}, $this->call->model('my_model')

To easily migrate from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 change all instances of $this->call->model() to the
example with second parameter. So if you have class Example_model {} before and you call it this way
$this->call->model('example') now you shoul do something like this $this->call->model('example_model', 'example')

## Add Pagination Class [2.0.3]

## ->exec() was added again for some technical reasons [2.0.2]
