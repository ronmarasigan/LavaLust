## Changelogs of Version 3

1. Remove xss_clean() using Escaper class. If you want to use it, install htmlpurifier library then
   create a function "xss_clean" inside a helper.
2. You can now use different instances of database connections. Changes also affect
   the database.php file inside the config folder. (Every instances depends on the key of database array
   variable.)
   $this->call->database();
   This will enable $this->db variable to handle queries.
   $this->call->database('other_connection');
   * This will open new connection based on the parameter "other_connection". You will
   need to create new index in database array named "other_connection" inside database.php
   file. It will enable $this->other_connection to handle queries.
3. Inside view fie, if you pass $data variable from controller, you can easily use the array key of
   it inside the view.
   Example: Controller

```php
        function index() {
            $this->call->model('user_model');
            $data['users'] = $this->user_model->get_all_users();
            $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
        }
```

        Inside view file you can extract values of $data['users] by just using its key "users"
        Example: View

```php
            foreach($users as $user) {
                echo $user['some_index'];
            }
```

        Moreover, you can also pass a plain string to view file.
        Example: Controller

```php function index() {
                $this->call->model('user_model');
                $data = "This is a string.";
                $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
            }
```

4. In models, you dont't need to add exec() method in insert(), update() and delete() because Lavalust
        automatically added it for you.
    Example: model
```php
            $this->db->insert($bind);
```
5. You can now use put models inside sub directories.
    Example: model/sub_dir/Sample_model.php
```php
            $this->call->model('sub_dir/sample');
            $this->sample->method();
```
6. You can now use http verb in routes. Just add the type of request after the route
    Example: 
```php
    $route['delete/:num']['delete'] = 'welcome/delete/$1';
```
    See docs for more info.
